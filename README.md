## USER STORY:
"AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience <br>
 building single-page applications <br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed <br>
React portfolio of work samples <br>
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate <br>
 for an open position."

   ## Installation :hammer_and_wrench:

   To install dependancies, run the following commands:

     
     `npm install` to install node_modules, <br>
      `npm start` to run in command line  
     ----
     `npm i express`
     ----
     `npx create-react-app react-portfolio`
     ----
     `npx create-react-app react-footer`-
     ----

     I used mainly CSS styling to edit the components pages and imported their corresponding .css file at the top using `import classes from './<Component>.module.css'`. <br>
     The navigation bar points to all the sections (About Me, Portfoilio/work, Contact, and my Resume.) <br>
     The footer contains logos that lead to my info on LinkedIn, Instagram, and Github.
